It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing market data and is structured using a **4-Tier Architecture**, where the **MVC pattern** is applied at the Presentation Layer.

The application follows the **Repository Pattern** for data management, ensuring separation of concerns. It includes **unit and integration tests** to enhance reliability. **SQL Server** is used for data storage, managed via **Entity Framework Core**. The application provides **logging** capabilities using **Serilog**.
